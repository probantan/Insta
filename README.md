```
I am still in the process of writing more tests and i havent commited them yet.

I will be sure to document them later and commit them.
Current tests test existing models,instantiation, model methods and relationships.

## Lets Encrypt
To add SSL certificates to your heroku app follow this [guide](https://medium.com/@joshua.massover/lets-encrypt-ssl-using-django-on-heroku-c35edaaaeaac), sadly you are to have a hobby account(7$/m)
 on the bright side the certificates are free and generated by [certbot](https://certbot.eff.org/) as part fo the [letsencrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) movement.
